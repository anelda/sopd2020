  Many surveys related to open science, open data, and open access have been developed over the years. 
  We've been sorting and comparing the questions and are developing a databank of pre-existing survey questions 
  that can be used for future surveys about data sharing practices.

        The Open Data report is a result of a year-long, co-conducted study between Elsevier and the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), part of Leiden University, the Netherlands.  The study is based on a complementary methods approach consisting of a quantitative analysis of bibliometric and publication data, a global survey of 1,200 researchers and three case studies including in-depth interviews with key individuals involved in data collection, analysis and deposition in the fields of soil science, human genetics and digital humanities.

        This study was commissioned by Wellcome Trust and investigated researchers' attitudes and 
        behaviours towards open reesarch, examined the sharing and reuse of research data, code, and 
        open access publications, in order to identify practical actions the Wellcome Trust 
        could take to remove or mitigate barriers and maximise the opportunities for practicing open science.

        In September 2016, Wiley contacted approximately 55,000 of their authors across many disciplines and 
        received more than 4,600 responses. The survey effort focused on Open Science, broadly aiming to 
        help them understand how researchers approach open access requirements, manage data, and participate 
        in the sharing and archiving of their research.

        This study was performed by researchers from University of Witwatersrand (South Africa) and 
        NEPAD-SANBio and funded through the International Network for the Availability of Scientific 
        Publications. 
        The survey interrogated not only perceptions of data sharing amongst LMIC scientists, but also how
         these are connected to the research environments and daily challenges experienced by them.

        In this study the DataONE Usability and Assessment working group addresses two primary goals... 
        To examine the current state of data sharing and reuse perceptions and practices among research 
        scientists as they compare to the 2009/2010 baseline study, and to examine differences in practices 
        and perceptions across age groups, geographic regions, and subject disciplines.
